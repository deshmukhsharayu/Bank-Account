# 🏦 BankAccount Class in Python

This project demonstrates a simple **BankAccount** class written in Python, showcasing **encapsulation** — a core concept of Object-Oriented Programming (OOP).

---

## 📌 Features

- Create a bank account with an owner name and starting balance.
- Keep the balance **private and secure**.
- Access balance through a **getter method**.
- Modify balance using:
  - `deposit(amount)`
  - `withdraw(amount)`
- Prevents direct access to the balance from outside the class.
- Validates deposit and withdrawal amounts.
